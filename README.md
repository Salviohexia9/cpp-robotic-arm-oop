# Robotic Arm Controller (C++ with OOP)

This project demonstrates an Object-Oriented approach to controlling a robotic arm with three servos (base, elbow, gripper) using C++ and Arduino.

# Features
- Modular C++ classes for each servo
- Centralized arm controller class
- Serial command-based movement ("base left", "grab")
